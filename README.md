# Welcome to Udacity Coffee Shop
Welcome to udacity coffee shop! This is a simple and fun full stack application that I used to learn and improve my skills at User Authentication and Authorization.
In addtion, I got some hands-on practice at setting up and implementing a code review infrastructure. 

## Technology Stack

There are two main directories to this application

<ul>
<li>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/heardMan/udacity-coffeeShop/backend">Backend Directory</a></h3>
<p>
This directory contains the flask application that acts as a server to the frontend application.

</ul>

## Virtual Environments

Use of a virtual environment is highly recommended and this application takes that into consideration.
Please name your virtual environment: <strong>venv</strong>
If for some reason you must name your virtual environment something other than venv 
please make sure to add the directory to the .gitignore file or your changes will be rejected in review.
